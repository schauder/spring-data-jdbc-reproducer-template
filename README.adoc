== Spring Data JDBC Reproducer Template

This is a template for reproducers for Spring Data JDBC issues.

It has the following properties, which I consider beneficial:

* Based on Maven, the build tool which is used also by Spring Data itself.
* Uses JUnit 5
* Includes AssertJ for assertions
* Uses Spring Test support for running setup scripts
* Uses Testcontainers for setting up a database.
